  <h3>Expert Dive Instructor</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
Pat earned multiple diving credentials while living and working in Fiji and
Australia. Later, Pat is hired by NOAA as a Dive Instructor, which requires
that they maintain certification as an instructor with additional specialist
diver certifications in dry suit, night diving, and search and recovery. The
dive instructor certification is public record, but the additional specialist
certifications are private because they are for personal diving, not acting
as an instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
Part of Pat's job is logging the certifications of fellow divers during NOAA
sanctioned dives.
    </p>
    <h4>Distinction</h4>
    <p>This use case is difficult because:
      <ul>
        <li>
Certification in Fiji and Australia. NOAA relies on an international
certification agency, PADI, with relevance in multiple jurisdictions.
        </li>
        <li>
Each of these <a>credentials</a> is issued by different schools in the name
of PADI.
        </li>
        <li>
Each <a>credential</a> has an independent expiration cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
Pat grants NOAA permission (the capability) to validate future
<a>credential</a> status changes.
        </li>
        <li>
On each trip, Pat creates a certified log of all divers, effectively issuing
a <a>verified credential</a> about other <a>credentials</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Scenario</h4>
    <p>
When Pat applied for his job at NOAA, he provided <a>verifiable credentials</a>
issued by different dive schools licensed by PADI to do so. NOAA verifies
cryptographically that the certifications were issued by PADI-approved dive
schools and that the credentials were still in good standing by checking both
the certifications' *and* the dive schools' revocation services.
    </p>
    <p>
Upon accepting the job, Pat issues NOAA a revocable token that allows NOAA to
check the current status of all of his certifications &mdash; not just the
status of a single <a>verifiable credential</a>. After any specific
certification expires &mdash; and Pat renews it &mdash; NOAA's next check of
Pat's certifications returns the status of the renewed certification, not just
the status of the (now expired) <a>verifiable credential</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
When Pat takes a group of divers on NOAA sanctioned dives, he records the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> for each diver (which demonstrate their diving
certifications), creates a <a>verifiable credential</a> including those
<a>credentials</a>; he signs and archives it on his laptop.
    </p>
    <p>
When Pat retires from NOAA, he revokes that token and NOAA staff is no longer
able to monitor his non-public certification status.
    </p>

<a>Verifiable credentials</a> submitted with job application
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Trust Hierarchy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
PADI is liable for correctly certifying dive schools.
      </li>
      <li>
Dive schools are liable for correctly certifying Pat's knowledge and skills.
      </li>
      <li>
Pat is liable for representing the facts in their application and maintaining
the revocable capability.
      </li>
      <li>
NOAA is liable for verifying the <a>credentials</a> and Pat's assertions
claiming them, and for assuring Pat's continued good standing for the required
<a>credentials</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
Pat is liable for making sure all divers, on each trip, have valid
<a>credentials</a> and are properly logged.
      </li>
      <li>
Diver's are liable for presenting valid <a>credentials</a>, specifically
<a>credentials</a> for which they are the <a>subject</a>, including any formal
identity <a>credentials</a>, e.g., passport or driver's license.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Threat model</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: <a>Issuer</a> is compromised.</strong> One of the dive schools
had their private keys stolen, but the school itself only ever issues valid
certificates.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Use multi-sig to prevent theft of a single key from
relevance
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Hardware wallet to minimize threat of network-based
attack
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Biometrically locked hardware wallet
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Frequent rotation to minimize exposure from stolen
keys
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Enhanced background checks for all individuals with

with individuals' keys plus credential from the school.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: A dive school could issue unearned certificates</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Audit certificate issuance. Record all issuance,
systemically spot check for validity.
          </li>

to limit impact of violation
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Limit time horizon that the school may issue on
behalf of PADI to require re-validation of qualifications
          </li>
          <li>

credentials
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Dive school could issue certificates with a revoked
authorization</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> <a>Holders</a> should verify the authorization,
before they buy the course
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> <a>Holders</a> should verify the authorization at
the point of receiving the <a>credential</a>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> <a>Verifiers</a> should also verify the
authorization of the <a>issuer</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Pat could send a proxy to earn their certificate</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong>  School should use multi-factor identity assurance
during registration and onsite when testing.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong>  Dive school retains video surveillance of event
for future audits
          </li>

participants and logs them for later audit
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Pat or another dive master could lie about a diver being on
the boat</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> NOAA requires divers listed to submit endorsement
that they were there (they endorse the dive log); divers mutually sign each
other's log entries
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Boat owner signs dive log
          </li>

<strong>Threat: Malware could take control of <a>issuer</a> or <a>verifier</a>
agent</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Run virus and malware scans regularly
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Isolate issuer agent system to an air-gapped
environment
          </li>
        </ul>

      <li>
<strong>Threat: Pat is phished, and Pat gives capability to the wrong
person/entity</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Use better identity assurance for the verifier,
i.e., don't give capability to strangers.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong>  Use Object Capabilities based on strong
authentication and well-known public keys.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: <a>Issuer</a> spoofs Pat, and Pat receives VC from
non-PADI-certified instructor</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong>  Pat runs PADI's wallet software to make sure any
certificates they receive are authentic.

          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong>  Pat checks the VC with a PADI-provided tool before
accepting it
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong>  Pat checks the VC with a standard tool, to see
that (1) There really is a PADI authentication and (2) PADI authentication is
actually from PADI
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Pat presents a fake credential as a PADI certification</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong>  NOAA verifies the signature on the certification
credential AND on the PADI authentication credential.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Pat's laptop on the boat could be compromised</strong>.
