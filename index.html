    <p>
A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece
of information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government
ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. Such a claim
describes a quality or qualities, property or properties of an <a>entity</a>
which establish its existence and uniqueness. The use cases outlined here are
provided in order to make progress toward possible future standardization and
interoperability of both low- and high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of
storing, transmitting, and receiving digitally verifiable proof of attributes
such as qualifications and achievements. The use cases in this document focus
on concrete scenarios that the technology defined by the group should address.
    </p>

    <p>
This document represents a concise but limited collection of use cases readers
should review alongside the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable
Credentials Data Model</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
The work on this document was carried out under tight time constraints due to
limitations of the W3C process and publishing deadlines. Under such conditions,
errors are unavoidable and some of the ideas presented here are incomplete.
The Working Group hopes that in the future, W3C process can be revised to better
support the dynamic nature of standards work in a more consistent way across
different groups.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The Verifiable Claims Working Group at the W3C is developing standards for
expressing and exchanging "<a>claims</a>" that have been verified by a third
party and to make them easier and more secure on the Web.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for the support of
Verifiable Claims.  Instead it expresses the sorts of needs that real users have
that could be addressed through support for some sort of self-sovereign claim
environment.  It attempts to use terminology that is consistent with the other
deliverables of the Verifiable Claims Working Group (you can see the relevant
terms in Appendix A).
    </div>
    <section>
      <h3>Importance of this work</h3>
      <p>
Entities (people, organizations, devices) need to make many kinds of
<a>claims</a> as part of their everyday activities. As more and more of these
important activities move to the Internet, <a>entities</a> need to be able to
transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims (e.g., about their location,
accomplishments, value, what-have-you). From educational records to payment
account access, the next generation of web applications will authorize
<a>entities</a> to perform actions based on rich sets of credentials issued by
trusted parties. Human- and machine-mediated decisions about job applications,
account access, collaboration, and professional development will depend on
filtering and analyzing growing amounts of data. It is essential that data be
verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it possible for many
stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these essential records about their
counterparties, without being locked into proprietary platforms.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Use case model</h3>
      <p>
This document presents an aggregate use case model, composed of Needs, Roles,
Tasks, and Sequences. Taken together, these models define the use cases that
the Verifiable Claims Working Group has addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
User needs define the problem space addressed by <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
User Roles specify the roles different <a>entities</a> play when interacting
with <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Tasks define the functions users can
accomplish, and sequences demonstrate how tasks might be realized, by
interactions between <a>entities</a> over time.
      </p>
      <p>
As with all models, this use case model is neither exhaustive nor complete. The
listed uses cannot capture all possible use cases. Similarly, the models do not
completely characterize the use cases represented. However, the combined model
is intended to provide specific, coherent guidance for the work ahead.

    <h2>User Roles</h2>
    <p>
There are four roles supported by <a>verifiable credentials</a>: <a>Issuer</a>,
<a>Verifier</a>, <a>Subject</a>, and <a>Holder</a>.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <dl>
      <dt>
Issuer
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> that creates a <a>claim</a> and associates it with a
particular <a>subject</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Verifier
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> verifying a <a>claim</a> about a given <a>subject</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Subject
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> about whom a <a>claim</a> is issued.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Holder
      </dt>
      <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. A <a>holder</a> is usually, but not always, the
<a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credentials</a> that they are holding.
<a>Holders</a> store their <a>credentials</a> in <a>credential repositories</a>.

    <h2>User Tasks</h2>
    <p>
Use cases are often used as a driver for requirements. While the users of
<a>verifiable credentials</a> have needs across many domains, the tasks
associated with those needs span the domains. This section summarizes those
tasks, as well as requirements related to the tasks, and maps the tasks and
requirements back to the associated needs.

It is worth noting that the <a>subject</a> may or may not be the same
<a>entity</a> as the <a>holder</a>. There are no tasks in these examples that
require participation of the <a>subject</a>.

        <dd>
          It MUST be possible for a <a>verifier</a> to verify that the
          credential is an authentic statement of an <a>issuer's</a>
          <a>claims</a> about the
          <a>subject</a>. Verifiers must have the capability to
          cryptographically prove that a credential has not been tampered
          with since issuance (authenticity) and that the issuer continues
          to assert the claims as true (currency). 
          
          To check authenticity, the issuer's verification methods, such as
          a public key, must be discoverable from the credential itself. It
          is expected that the issuer identifier either is
          cryptographically verifiable itself or that it can be used to
          reliably discover the cryptographic material necessary to confirm
          that the content of a credential has not been changed since
          issuance. It is understood that verification depends on the
          verifier's acceptance of the robustness of the cryptographic
          mechanisms used for testing authenticity and for discovering
          verification methods. An untrusted verification method cannot be
          relied upon for verification.

          To check the currency of a credential, verifiers must be able to
          inquire about the current status of a credential without
          revealing to the issuer 
          <ol type="a">
             <li>Who is requesting status</li>
             <li>Which credential is being checked</li>
             <li>The subject of the credential being checked</li> 
          </ol>
          This status check allows issuers to revoke, suspend, or otherwise
          moderate the status of the credential.

          Similarly, if a discovery mechanism is used to retrieve
          verification methods for a given issuer, verifiers must be able
          to do so without revealing unnecessary information to the issuer.

          In short, it must be possible to fully verify a credential
          without leaking usage data to the issuer or anyone else. This
          avoids the so-called "phone home" problem.

          In many environments (such as order processing) information such
          as a payer's address, citizenship, or age need to be

      <h3>Validate Claim</h3>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Requirement</dt>
        <dd>
          It MUST be possible for a <a>verifier</a> to validate that the a
          given claim is appropriate for particular use. That is, given the
          credential is authentic and current, the verifier must then
          interpret the claims in the context of their own 'business rules'
          about which parties are acceptable authorities and which
          cryptographic mechanisms are acceptable for different situations.
          <ol>
            <li>Is the issuer someone we know?</li>
            <li>Are the claims made by this issuer appropriate for that
            particular issuer's authority?</li>
            <li>Is the holder's presentation an appropriate use of the
            credential?</li>
          </ol>
          The first and second question will be answered either because the
          verifier already knows the public identifiers for the issuers it
          recognizes for specific claims, or there is a discovery mechanism
          whereby verifiers can find appropriate issuers given their
          business requirements. 
          
          The business rules may allow the use of certain credentials for
          specific situations even when they are expired. For example a
          suspended professional license may be accepted by an employer as
          evidence of past experience without treating it as a current
          qualification for roles that require that license. For this
          reason, currency (as part of verification) only deals with the
          status of the credential as maintained by the Issuer. Timeliness
          is the domain of validation.

          It's important to note that the bounds of authority for a given
          issuer are specific claim types made by them and relied upon by
          others. While the DMV might be an acceptable authority for an
          individual's driving privilege, it should probably not be treated
          as authoritative for an individual's hair color or current
          address, even though DMVs regularly include such claims in
          today's driver's licenses.

          Unlike verification, validation cannot be guaranteed to be
          automatable. Some use cases require human review before accepting
          a particular credential for a particular use. For example, a
          digital proof of age system might need a trusted human agent to
          visually compare the holder/presenter in real-space to a
          reference photo securely referenced in the VC, before accepting a
          credential as valid.
        </dd>
        <dt>Motivations</dt>
        <dd>
          Verifiers need to be able to apply their own policies and rules
          to the information they rely on to run their business. (And we
          mean business broadly to encompass all focused activity towards a
          goal.)

          As such, any given VC could be verified but unusable in a
          particular situation. For example, a self-issued driver's license
          would likely not be acceptable for a car rental by most car
          rental agencies, even though the verification succeeds. 
          
          However, in some cases, such as at a go-cart racing facility, it
          may be entirely appropriate to accept the name and image from a
          self-issued license for the purpose of leaderboards,
          announcements, and correspondence.

          These business rules are entirely up to the verifier. Only after
          satisfying these rules should a verifier rely upon a claim as an
          accepted fact for specific use.

      <h3>Citizenship by Parentage</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
Sam wants to claim US citizenship because his mother is American. Sam has a
digital birth certificate from Kenya, where he was born while his Mother was
in the Peace corps. He also has a digital version of his mother's US passport.
Because his mother’s name changed between his birth and the issuance of the
passport, Sam also has a marriage license with her maiden and married names.
Sam is applying for a new passport from the US Secretary of State.
        </p>
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>
This use case is challenging because the mother’s name changed, by marriage,
between the issuance of the birth certificate and passport.
        </p>
        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>
Sam’s mother emailed him the certificate, license, and passport as independent
<a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. He then creates a <a>verifiable presentation</a>
which includes those credentials, a statement of their relationship to each
other and his relationship to his mother. He then visits the US Secretary of
State website, creates an account, starts the application for a passport, and
uploads his new <a>verifiable presentation</a> as supporting evidence. After
processing the application, Sam is issued both a traditional passport and a
new digital passport.

          <li>
He is the child in the birth certificate.
          </li>

The mother in the birth certificate, the person in the passport, the spouse in
the marriage license are all the same person.

Sam is legally liable for his claim to the rights of citizenship. The state

        <h4>Threat model</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Terrorist / Identity fraud.</strong> A bad actor could be
impersonating Sam to attain a passport. Of course, if a bad actor were to be
able to collect the required <a>verifiable credentials</a>&mdash;mother’s
passport, birth certificate, and marriage license, that actor has already
significantly compromised the system.

              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Identity assurance based on the contents of the
<a>claims</a>, potentially with enhanced data embedded in the <a>claims</a>,
i.e., data not currently in passports, birth certificates, or marriage license.
For example, a biometric template could be embedded in the birth certificate
<a>claim</a> and that template could be used for interactive identity assurance
at the time of submitting the <a>presentation</a>.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Exposure of private information.</strong>  By storing
potentially compromising information in <a>credentials</a> and sending them
over the network, we are increasing the attack surface for the <a>subjects</a>
of those credentials.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> (once by issuer, every

      <h3>Expert Dive Instructor</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
Pat earned multiple diving credentials while living and working in Fiji and
Australia. Later, Pat is hired by NOAA as a Dive Instructor, which requires
that they maintain certification as an instructor with additional specialist
diver certifications in dry suit, night diving, and search and recovery. The
dive instructor certification is public record, but the additional specialist
certifications are private because they are for personal diving, not acting
as an instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
Part of Pat's job is logging the certifications of fellow divers during NOAA
sanctioned dives.
        </p>
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>This use case is difficult because:
          <ul>
            <li>
Certification in Fiji and Australia. NOAA relies on an international
certification agency, PADI, with relevance in multiple jurisdictions.
            </li>
            <li>
Each of these <a>credentials</a> is issued by different schools in the name
of PADI.
            </li>
            <li>
Each <a>credential</a> has an independent expiration cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
Pat grants NOAA permission (the capability) to validate future
<a>credential</a> status changes.
            </li>
            <li>
On each trip, Pat creates a certified log of all divers, effectively issuing
a <a>verified credential</a> about other <a>credentials</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>
When Pat applied for his job at NOAA, he provided <a>verifiable credentials</a>
issued by different dive schools licensed by PADI to do so. NOAA verifies
cryptographically that the certifications were issued by PADI-approved dive
schools and that the credentials were still in good standing by checking both
the certifications' *and* the dive schools' revocation services.
        </p>
        <p>
Upon accepting the job, Pat issues NOAA a revocable token that allows NOAA to
check the current status of all of his certifications &mdash; not just the
status of a single <a>verifiable credential</a>. After any specific
certification expires &mdash; and Pat renews it &mdash; NOAA's next check of
Pat's certifications returns the status of the renewed certification, not just
the status of the (now expired) <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
When Pat takes a group of divers on NOAA sanctioned dives, he records the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> for each diver (which demonstrate their diving
certifications), creates a <a>verifiable credential</a> including those
<a>credentials</a>; he signs and archives it on his laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
When Pat retires from NOAA, he revokes that token and NOAA staff is no longer
able to monitor his non-public certification status.

    <h3>International Travel with Minor and Upgrade</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
Malathi is traveling internationally with her 8-month-old son, Anand. His
father, Rajesh, is staying home. Malathi has enough frequent flyer miles to
upgrade the ticket to first class.
        </p>
      <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>
This use case is difficult because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
Current US passports do not establish explicit relationship between parent
and child.
          </li>
          <li>
When one parent travels with a minor, the other parent is required to grant
permission for the trip, thus implying guardianship or responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
The DID or other Digital Identity system replaces the role of the notary in
the paper/physical world
          </li>
          <li>
Credentials must be coordinated between two verifiers (agent and airline) for
two individuals, and a digital coupon is used.
          </li>
          <li>
The relationship of the minor to the non-traveling parent must be established,
in order for the permission to be considered.
          </li>
          <li>
In the minor's passport case, the <a>subject</a> is not the <a>holder</a> of
the <a>verifiable credential</a>. The <a>holder</a> of the passport is a
parent, not the minor.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>
Malathi obtains permission from Rajesh stating she is allowed to take the baby
out of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
Prior to booking the trips, Malathi visits HappyAir.com to request an upgrade
to first class. HappyAir issues a <a>verifiable credential</a> redeemable for
a first class upgrade on an international flight.
        </p>
        <p>
She books the plane tickets through her travel agent who adds the lap child
to the ticket.
        </p>
        <p>
HappyAir verifies that Malathi has a signed statement from Anand’s other
parent stating that she may exit the country with him.
        </p>

      <h4>Verifiable Credentials</h4>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>

in Appendix
        </p>

      <h4>Verifiable Presentation</h4>
        <p>
Submitted to HappyAir, includes Malathi and Anand's passport, assertion of
permission, birth certificate and Frequent Flyer coupon.
        </p>

      <h4>Trust Hierarchy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Malathi is liable for her claim of parentage as well as securing right to
admission for herself and her son at their destination (visa may be required).
          </li>
          <li>
Malathi and Rajesh are both liable for attestation of permission to fly with
Anand without the other parent.
          </li>
          <li>
Malathi is liable for the cost of her ticket and her son’s ticket.
          </li>
          <li>
The agency is liable for issuing valid tickets and for verifying the
credentials provided by the travelers.
          </li>
          <li>
The airline is liable for issuing tickets and, ultimately, fulfilling the
terms of travel
          </li>
          <li>
The airline is liable for accepting the upgrade coupons at ticketing.
          </li>
          <li>
The airline is liable for verifying the credentials in the birth certificate
match the credentials in the permission letter.
          </li>
          <li>
The check-in agent, TSA agent, and passport control at the destination are
liable for identity assurance at various points of travel, using information
contained in the <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Threat model</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen Key.</strong> Malathi steals Rajesh’s key in order to
fake travel permission. (Kidnapping her own kids and fleeing Rajesh.)
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could store his key with a trusted third
party, such as an attorney.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could use a hardware wallet with pin or
biometric.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could use a passphrase on his key
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen Key 2</strong> Ticket purchaser has Malathi’s
<a>credentials</a>, impersonating her to purchase a ticket. This could enable
a third-party kidnapping.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Travel permission can be restricted to specific
date and or trip minimizing abuse potential.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Embed identifying characteristics or biometric into
the credentials so that verifiers can independently verify the <a>subject</a>
in front of them is the <a>subject</a> in the <a>credential</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Malathi could use a hardware wallet with pin or
biometric.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Malathi could use a passphrase on her key
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Exposure of private information.</strong> By storing
potentially compromising information in credentials and sending them over the
network, we are increasing the attack surface for the <a>subjects</a> of those
credentials.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> (once by <a>issuer</a>;
every <a>verifier</a> gets the same encrypted blob)
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. This may leak usage data to the <a>issuer</a>, assuming the
<a>holder</a> must ask for a new, encrypted <a>credential</a> for each
<a>verifier</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Blind the <a>claims</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>presentation</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. No issuer involved
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen coupon</strong> Rajesh falsifies the upgrade coupon.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> HappyAir signs the coupon with secure credentials.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Travel agent verifies the coupon through a
distributed status registry, verifying it is still valid
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

    <h2>User Sequences</h2>
    <p>
The transaction examples in this section show basic ways in which
<a>verifiable credentials</a> might be used. They are not meant to be
architecturally constraining. Instead, they are meant to help illustrate the
basic way it <em>could</em> be done in a typical commerce situation. Again
&mdash; please remember that it is just an example, and should not be thought
of as the canonical way such a <a>claims</a> environment must be implemented.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>How a Verifiable Credential Might Be Created</h3>
      <p>
In this first example, a user will request a verifiable credential&mdash;a
confirmation of their identity. Consider this illustration:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img aria-describedby="claim_flow"
             alt="Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Description"
             style="display:block; margin:auto"
             src="uc-issuing-claims.svg" />
        <figcaption>Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Diagram</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Expanding on these steps:
      </p>
        <ol id="claim_flow" title="Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Description">
          <li>
Jane asks her User Agent to help her get a <a>verifiable credential</a> about
her identity.
          </li>
          <li>
Her user agent connects her to a <a>credential</a> <a>issuer</a> that is able to
<a>verify</a> her identity.
          </li>
          <li>
The issuer examines her documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
They are satisfied, so the <a>issuer</a> generates a
<a>verifiable credential</a> for Jane that includes information about her
identity linked to their own trusted <a>credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The issuer delivers the <a>verifiable credential</a> back to Jane's User Agent.
          </li>
          <li>
Jane views the <a>verifiable credential</a> to ensure it reflects her requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
When she is satisfied, she instructs her User Agent to save the
<a>verifiable credential</a> so she can use it in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
The UA communicates with her <a>credential repository</a>, instructing it to
store the new <a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> returns a list of the 
<a>verifiable credentials</a> it is holding for Jane to the UA.
          </li>
          <li>
The UA shows Jane her <a>verifiable credential</a> collection &mdash;
confirming everything she has available.
          </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How a Verifiable Credential Might Be Used</h3>
        <p>
In this example, a <a>holder</a> of a <a>claim</a> needs to use that
<a>claim</a> in a typical commerce situation:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img aria-describedby="vf-flow"
               alt="Verifiable Credential Usage Flow Diagram"
               style="display:block; margin:auto"
               src="example.svg" />
          <figcaption>
Verifiable Credential Usage Flow Diagram
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ol title="Verifiable Credential Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
          <li>
Jane decides to shop on the website WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and requests (via a user
agent-supported API call) that Jane prove this.
          </li>
          <li>
Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential repository</a> for the proof.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> shows Jane some <a>verifiable credentials</a>
it holds that can support her age claim (e.g., her passport, driving license,
and birth certificate).
          </li>
          <li>
Jane selects one of these, and authorizes that it be shared with the merchant.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> returns the selected <a>credential</a> as a
response to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers it to
the merchant.
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant's server verifies that the <a>claim</a> is valid and satisfies
the requirement.
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site with appropriate
authorization.
          </li>
        </ol>
